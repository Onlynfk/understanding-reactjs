​using useEffect 
runs after very component state changes
no dependencies -- runs only once 

 localstorage pretty cool


useEffect with no dependencies runs only once
useEffect handles side effect  ( forms change, response form http)
--- a response to some other action ins useEffect

notes 
-- built in api, component-intrnal variable should not be added as dependies yeah !!

or stuff like declared variables that really depends on it __

​useEffect cleanup function !!!!!!!​
Debouncing (okay !!)
using setTimeout() --- 

the cleanup function runs after very next side effect
execution
