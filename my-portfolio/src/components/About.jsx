        <p>
          In the last couple of years, I have been spending most of my time
          creating simple and complex web projects. <br /> In my spare time, I
          write programming articles on what new stuffs I learnt or on the
          problems I faced and how I solved them.
          <br /> And for my hobbies I enjoy playing games mostly🎮

          that I want to brag about.
